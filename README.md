# JanetIssueTracker

To make Janet create an issue for the most popular suggestions on the forums, or if there are detailed enough reports in the bug_reports slack channel. This can also include replying on the forums/locking a post when an issue is closed here.

### Possible features that will be included

Parses #bug_reports channel and creates issues based on detailed messages.

Parses suggestions on the forums using the REST API to create issues when they have a positive enough reaction (+1, or other positive reactions).

Close suggestions on forums with explanation why and lock.

Maybe when a bug report that was posted in Slack gets fixed, post a message to the #bug_reports channel saying it is now fixed.
